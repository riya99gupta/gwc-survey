#Welcome to YAML! This is where you will be writing up your questions and answer choices, as well as 
#the response messages and the ranges of scores for the quiz! 
#Remember, YAML is written as a list, but when it's imported to python, it becomes a python dictionary 
#Score and Survey are both keys, and the following lists are their values, but each of those values are 
#dictionaries as well. So, these are dictionaries within dictionaries. 
#Syntax is important in YAML! Each indent is TWO spaces (do not hit the tab key only)
#NEVER HIT THE TAB KEY. YAML cannot read tabs. Use the spacebar instead. 
#
#
#This is the section that determines score ranges and their corresponding return messages. 
        #In order to change the range, simply change the numbers within the brackets
        #In order to change the return message, change the words in the string. Make sure that it is contained 
        #within quotation marks. 
        #In order to add a new range, copy the syntax as it's already written. 
        #REMEMBER: Everytime you add a new question with point values, you have to adjust the ranges. You can usually just add the max number of points to the greater end of the ranges. 
score: 
- Range: [0, 12]

#This is the section that allows you to write the questions for the survey. Note that each key in the survey dictionary nests three of it's own dictionaires, a query (that determines the question), a key (that gives the question a key word to identify it in the code), and choices (that contain their own nested dictionaries with answer choices). 
#In order to add more questions, simply copy down the syntax as it is and fill in the strings. Make sure everything is contained within strings. If you add a question in between, make sure you change the number markers.
